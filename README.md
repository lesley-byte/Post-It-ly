## 🏗️App Structure

- **index.html:** This is the main entry point for the Sticky-Notes Board app & it contains the basic structure of the webpage. It links to the style.css for styling and script.js for functionality.
- **style.css:** This file contains the CSS code that defines the overall look & feel of the app. It also contains additional styles to ensure responsiveness across devices. The styles are applied to the elements defined in index.html to enhance the user experience.
- **script.js:** This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the app's functionality. It contains the core logic, utility functions (e.g., creating, editing, & deleting the notes), and local storage that can be reused throughout the app. The script.js file interacts with the elements in index.html by manipulating the DOM, based on the user's actions (i.e., clicking buttons or typing notes).
